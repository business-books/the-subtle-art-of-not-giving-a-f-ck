In it Manson argues that life's struggles give it meaning and that the unreasonable positivity of typical self-help books is neither practical nor useful.

People often say that the key to trust and success in life is to simply "don't give a shit". In fact, we often refer to the strongest and most admirable people we know in terms of their lack of fucking. Like "Oh, look again at Susie who works weekends, she doesn't give a shit." Or "Did you hear that Tom called the president of the company an asshole and still got a raise? Holy shit, that guy doesn't give a shit." Or "Jason got up and finished his date with Cindy after 20 minutes. He said he wouldn't listen to his bullshit anymore. Dude, that guy doesn't give a shit."

The Subtle Art of Not Giving PDF is a masterpiece, incredibly funny. I'm not used to looking for self-help books because to me they are all the same! Smile more, love more, hate less, don't give up, you'll be fine, it's all in your head. Blah blah blah ... but this one was the exception. Anything with swear words on the cover piques my interest: P The first half was my favorite, the purpose of this book is to help the reader think a little more clearly about what he chooses to find important in life. and what they choose to find irrelevant.

Self-improvement and success often happen together. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's the same thing. Our culture today is obsessively driven by unrealistic, positive expectations: be happier. Be healthier. Be the best, better than the rest.
